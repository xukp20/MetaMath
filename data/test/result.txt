Input a problem: What is the value of $101^{3} - 3 \cdot 101^{2} + 3 \cdot 101 -1$?
Choose Raw or Hint (R/others): H
Hint:   To simplify the expression, we can consider using the property of exponents that states $(a^m)^n = a^{mn}$.
GPT: [[ Actually, the expression $101^{3} - 3 \cdot 101^{2} + 3 \cdot 101 -1$ is in the form of $(a-b)^3$ which is $a^3 - 3a^2b + 3ab^2 - b^3$. Here, $a=101$ and $b=1$. So, we can rewrite the expression as $(101-1)^3$. ]]

Hint:   To simplify the expression, we can calculate the cubic of the difference of two numbers.
GPT: [[ Yes, now we can simplify $(101-1)^3$ to $100^3$. ]]

Hint:   To find the value of $100^3$, we can calculate it directly.
GPT: [[ Yes, $100^3$ equals $1,000,000$. So, the answer is: $1,000,000$. ]]

Hint:   Summarize your findings and state the final answer clearly.
GPT: [[ The expression $101^{3} - 3 \cdot 101^{2} + 3 \cdot 101 -1$ simplifies to $(101-1)^3$ which is $100^3$. The value of $100^3$ is $1,000,000$. Therefore, the answer is: $1,000,000$. ]]




















Input a problem: A bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?
Choose Raw or Hint (R/others): H
Hint:   To find the expected value of the game, we can use the definition of expected value.
GPT: [[ The expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and then summing these products. In this case, the outcomes are winning 1 dollar (which happens when a white ball is drawn) and losing 1 dollar (which happens when a black ball is drawn). The probabilities of these outcomes depend on the number of white and black balls, respectively. 

Let's denote the probability of drawing a white ball as P(W) and the probability of drawing a black ball as P(B). 

P(W) = 5 / (5 + k) 
P(B) = k / (5 + k) 

The expected value of the game is then E = 1*P(W) - 1*P(B). 

We know that the expected loss is 50 cents, which means the expected value is -0.5 dollars. So we have the equation:

1*P(W) - 1*P(B) = -0.5. ]]

Hint:   To find the value of P(W), we can simplify the equation by isolating P(W) on one side.
GPT: [[ To isolate P(W), we can add P(B) to both sides of the equation:

1*P(W) = -0.5 + P(B)

Now, we can substitute the expressions for P(W) and P(B) that we found earlier:

5 / (5 + k) = -0.5 + k / (5 + k) ]]

Hint:   To simplify the equation, we can multiply both sides by the denominator of the coefficient of $k$.
GPT: [[ The denominator of the coefficients of $k$ is (5 + k). So, we multiply both sides of the equation by (5 + k) to get rid of the fractions:

5 = -0.5*(5 + k) + k

This simplifies to:

5 = -2.5 - 0.5k + k. ]]

Hint:   To isolate $k$, we can simplify the equation by subtracting $2.5$ from both sides and combining like terms.
GPT: [[ Subtracting 2.5 from both sides gives:

5 + 2.5 = -0.5k + k

Simplifying the left side gives:

7.5 = -0.5k + k

Combining like terms on the right side gives:

7.5 = 0.5k. ]]

Hint:   To find the value of $k$, we can simplify the equation by dividing both sides by the coefficient of $k$.
GPT: [[ The coefficient of $k$ is 0.5. So, we divide both sides of the equation by 0.5 to solve for $k$:

7.5 / 0.5 = k

This simplifies to:

k = 15

So, the answer is: $k = 15$. ]]

Answer: [[ $k = 15$. ]]
