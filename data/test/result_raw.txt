Input a problem: What is the value of $101^{3} - 3 \cdot 101^{2} + 3 \cdot 101 -1$?
Choose Raw or Hint (R/others): R
GPT: [[ First, let's calculate the value of $101^{3}$, $101^{2}$ and $3 \cdot 101$.

$101^{3} = 1030301$

$101^{2} = 10201$

$3 \cdot 101 = 303$

So, the expression becomes $1030301 - 3 \cdot 10201 + 303 - 1$. ]]

GPT: [[ Next, let's calculate the value of $3 \cdot 10201$.

$3 \cdot 10201 = 30603$

So, the expression becomes $1030301 - 30603 + 303 - 1$. ]]

GPT: [[ Now, let's perform the subtraction and addition operations.

$1030301 - 30603 = 1000698$

$1000698 + 303 = 1001001$

$1001001 - 1 = 1001000$

So, the value of the expression $101^{3} - 3 \cdot 101^{2} + 3 \cdot 101 -1$ is $1001000$. ]]

GPT: [[ There are no more steps to perform. 

The answer is: $1001000$. ]]

Input a problem: A bin has 5 white balls and $k$ black balls in it, where $k$ is an unknown positive integer.  A ball is drawn at random from the bin.  If a white ball is drawn, the player wins 1 dollar, but if a black ball is drawn, the player loses 1 dollar.  If the expected $\textit{loss}$ for playing the game is 50 cents, then what is $k$?
Choose Raw or Hint (R/others): R
GPT: [[ The expected value of a random variable is the sum of the possible values of the variable, each multiplied by the probability of that value occurring. 

In this case, the possible values are $1$ (if a white ball is drawn) and $-1$ (if a black ball is drawn). 

The probability of drawing a white ball is $\frac{5}{5+k}$, and the probability of drawing a black ball is $\frac{k}{5+k}$. 

So, the expected value of the game is $1 \cdot \frac{5}{5+k} + (-1) \cdot \frac{k}{5+k}$. 

We are told that this expected value is $-0.5$ (since the expected loss is 50 cents). 

So, we have the equation $1 \cdot \frac{5}{5+k} - 1 \cdot \frac{k}{5+k} = -0.5$. ]]

GPT: [[ Let's simplify the equation.

We can combine the fractions on the left side of the equation to get $\frac{5-k}{5+k} = -0.5$. 

Then, we can multiply both sides of the equation by $5+k$ to get rid of the denominator on the left side. 

This gives us $5 - k = -0.5(5 + k)$. ]]

GPT: [[ Next, let's distribute the $-0.5$ on the right side of the equation.

This gives us $5 - k = -2.5 - 0.5k$.

Then, let's add $k$ to both sides of the equation to get $5 = -2.5 + 0.5k$.

And finally, let's add $2.5$ to both sides of the equation to get $7.5 = 0.5k$. ]]

GPT: [[ Now, we can solve for $k$ by dividing both sides of the equation by $0.5$.

This gives us $k = \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15$.

So, the answer is: $k = 15$. ]]

Answer: [[ $k = 15$. ]]
